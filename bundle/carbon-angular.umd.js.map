This is also the case for when a sub animation is\n * queried by a parent and then later animated using `animateChild()`.\n *\n * ### Detecting when an animation is disabled\n * If a region of the DOM (or the entire application) has its animations disabled, the animation\n * trigger callbacks still fire, but for zero seconds. When the callback fires, it provides\n * an instance of an `AnimationEvent`. If animations are disabled,\n * the `.disabled` flag on the event is true.\n *\n * @experimental Animation support is experimental.\n */\nfunction trigger(name, definitions) {\n    return { type: 7 /* Trigger */, name: name, definitions: definitions, options: {} };\n}\n/**\n * Defines an animation step that combines styling information with timing information.\n *\n * @param timings Sets `AnimateTimings` for the parent animation.\n * A string in the format \"duration [delay] [easing]\".\n *  - Duration and delay are expressed as a number and optional time unit,\n * such as \"1s\" or \"10ms\" for one second and 10 milliseconds, respectively.\n * The default unit is milliseconds.\n *  - The easing value controls how the animation accelerates and decelerates\n * during its runtime.

An expression is evaluated each time a state change occurs in the\n * animation trigger element.\n * The animation steps run when the expression evaluates to true.\n *\n * - A state-change string takes the form \"state1 => state2\", where each side is a defined animation\n * state, or an asterix (*) to refer to a dynamic start or end state.\n *   - The expression string can contain multiple comma-separated statements;\n * for example \"state1 => state2, state3 => state4\".\n *   - Special values `:enter` and `:leave` initiate a transition on the entry and exit states,\n * equivalent to  \"void => *\"  and \"* => void\".\n *   - Special values `:increment` and `:decrement` initiate a transition when a numeric value has\n * increased or decreased in value.\n * - A function is executed each time a state change occurs in the animation trigger element.\n * The animation steps run when the function returns true.\n *\n * @param steps One or more animation objects, as returned by the `animate()` or\n * `sequence()` function, that form a transformation from one state to another.\n * A sequence is used by default when you pass an array.\n * @param options An options object that can contain a delay value for the start of the animation,\n * and additional developer-defined parameters. Provided values for additional parameters are used\n * as defaults, and override values can be passed to the caller on invocation.\n * @returns An object that encapsulates the transition data.\n *\n * @usageNotes\n * The template associated with a component binds an animation trigger to an element.\n *\n * ```HTML\n * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->\n * <div [@myAnimationTrigger]=\"myStatusExp\">...</div>\n * ```\n *\n * All transitions are defined within an animation trigger,\n * along with named states that the transitions change to and from.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * trigger(\"myAnimationTrigger\", [\n *  // define states\n *  state(\"on\", style({ background: \"green\" })),\n *  state(\"off\", style({ background: \"grey\" })),\n *  ...]\n * ```\n *\n * Note that when you call the `sequence()` function within a `{@link animations/group group()}`\n * or a `transition()` call, execution does not continue to the next instruction\n * until each of the inner animation steps have completed.\n *\n * ### Syntax examples\n *\n * The following examples define transitions between the two defined states (and default states),\n * using various options:\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // Transition occurs when the state value\n * // bound to \"myAnimationTrigger\" changes from \"on\" to \"off\"\n * transition(\"on => off\", animate(500))\n * // Run the same animation for both directions\n * transition(\"on <=> off\", animate(500))\n * // Define multiple state-change pairs separated by commas\n * transition(\"on => off, off => void\", animate(500))\n * ```\n *\n * ### Special values for state-change expressions\n *\n * - Catch-all state change for when an element is inserted into the page and the\n * destination state is unknown:\n *\n * ```typescript\n * transition(\"void => *\", [\n *  style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *  animate(500)\n *  ])\n * ```\n *\n * - Capture a state change between any states:\n *\n *  `transition(\"* => *\", animate(\"1s 0s\"))`\n *\n * - Entry and exit transitions:\n *\n * ```typescript\n * transition(\":enter\", [\n *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n *   ]),\n * transition(\":leave\", [\n *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 0 }))\n *   ])\n * ```\n *\n * - Use `:increment` and `:decrement` to initiate transitions:\n *\n * ```typescript\n * transition(\":increment\", group([\n *  query(':enter', [\n *     style({ left: '100%' }),\n *     animate('0.5s ease-out', style('*'))\n *   ]),\n *  query(':leave', [\n *     animate('0.5s ease-out', style({ left: '-100%' }))\n *  ])\n * ]))\n *\n * transition(\":decrement\", group([\n *  query(':enter', [\n *     style({ left: '100%' }),\n *     animate('0.5s ease-out', style('*'))\n *   ]),\n *  query(':leave', [\n *     animate('0.5s ease-out', style({ left: '-100%' }))\n *  ])\n * ]))\n * ```\n *\n * ### State-change functions\n *\n * Here is an example of a `fromState` specified as a state-change function that invokes an\n * animation when true:\n *\n * ```typescript\n * transition((fromState, toState) =>\n *  {\n *   return fromState == \"off\" && toState == \"on\";\n *  },\n *  animate(\"1s 0s\"))\n * ```\n *\n * ### Animating to the final state\n *\n * If the final step in a transition is a call to `animate()` that uses a timing value\n * with no style data, that step is automatically considered the final animation arc,\n * for the element to reach the final state. Angular automatically adds or removes\n * CSS styles to ensure that the element is in the correct final state.\n *\n * The following example defines a transition that starts by hiding the element,\n * then makes sure that it animates properly to whatever state is currently active for trigger:\n *\n * ```typescript\n * transition(\"void => *\", [\n *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *   animate(500)\n *  ])\n * ```\n * ### Boolean value matching\n * If a trigger binding value is a Boolean, it can be matched using a transition expression\n * that compares true and false or 1 and 0. For example:\n *\n * ```\n * // in the template\n * <div [@openClose]=\"open ? true : false\">...</div>\n * // in the component metadata\n * trigger('openClose', [\n *   state('true', style({ height: '*' })),\n *   state('false', style({ height: '0px' })),\n *   transition('false <=> true', animate(500))\n * ])\n * ```\n **/\nfunction transition(stateChangeExpr, steps, options) {\n    if (options === void 0) { options = null; }\n    return { type: 1 /* Transition */, expr: stateChangeExpr, animation: steps, options: options };\n}\n/**\n * Produces a reusable animation that can be invoked in another animation or sequence,\n * by calling the `useAnimation()` function.\n *\n * @param steps One or more animation objects, as returned by the `animate()`\n * or `sequence()` function, that form a transformation from one state to another.\n * A sequence is used by default when you pass an array.\n * @param options An options object that can contain a delay value for the start of the\n * animation, and additional developer-defined parameters.\n * Provided values for additional parameters are used as defaults,\n * and override values can be passed to the caller on invocation.\n * @returns An object that encapsulates the animation data.\n *\n * @usageNotes\n * The following example defines a reusable animation, providing some default parameter\n * values.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * var fadeAnimation = animation([\n *   style({ opacity: '{{ start }}' }),\n *   animate('{{ time }}',\n *   style({ opacity: '{{ end }}'}))\n *   ],\n *   { params: { time: '1000ms', start: 0, end: 1 }});\n * ```\n *\n * The following invokes the defined animation with a call to `useAnimation()`,\n * passing in override parameter values.\n *\n * ```js\n * useAnimation(fadeAnimation, {\n *   params: {\n *     time: '2s',\n *     start: 1,\n *     end: 0\n *   }\n * })\n * ```\n *\n * If any of the passed-in parameter values are missing from this call,\n * the default values are used.

You can do that\n * by providing a template to `TableItem`.\n *\n * ```html\n * <ng-template #customTableItemTemplate let-data=\"data\">\n * \t<a [routerLink]=\"data.link\">{{data.name}} {{data.surname}}</a>\n * </ng-template>\n * ```\n *\n * ```typescript\n * customTableItemTemplate: TemplateRef<any>;\n *\n * this.customModel.data = [\n * \t[new TableItem({data: \"asdf\"}), new TableItem({data: {name: \"Lessy\", link: \"/table\"}, template: this.customTableItemTemplate})],\n * \t[new TableItem({data: \"csdf\"}), new TableItem({data: \"swer\"})],\n * \t[new TableItem({data: \"bsdf\"}), new TableItem({data: {name: \"Alice\", surname: \"Bob\"}, template: this.customTableItemTemplate})],\n * \t[new TableItem({data: \"csdf\"}), new TableItem({data: \"twer\"})],\n * ];\n * ```\n *\n * ### Sorting and filtering\n *\n * In case you need custom sorting and/or filtering you should subclass `TableHeaderItem`\n * and override needed functions.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * class FilterableHeaderItem extends TableHeaderItem {\n * \t// custom filter function\n * \tfilter(item: TableItem): boolean {\n * \t\tif (typeof item.data === \"string\" && item.data.toLowerCase().indexOf(this.filterData.data.toLowerCase()) >= 0 ||\n * \t\titem.data.name && item.data.name.toLowerCase().indexOf(this.filterData.data.toLowerCase()) >= 0 ||\n * \t\titem.data.surname && item.data.surname.toLowerCase().indexOf(this.filterData.data.toLowerCase()) >= 0) {\n * \t\t\treturn false;\n * \t\t}\n * \t\treturn true;\n * \t}\n *\n * \tset filterCount(n) {}\n * \tget filterCount() {\n * \t\treturn (this.filterData && this.filterData.data && this.filterData.data.length > 0) ? 1 : 0;\n * \t}\n *\n * \t// used for custom sorting\n * \tcompare(one: TableItem, two: TableItem) {\n * \t\tconst stringOne = (one.data.name || one.data.surname || one.data).toLowerCase();\n * \t\tconst stringTwo = (two.data.name || two.data.surname || two.data).toLowerCase();\n *\n * \t\tif (stringOne > stringTwo) {\n * \t\t\treturn 1;\n * \t\t} else if (stringOne < stringTwo) {\n * \t\t\treturn -1;\n * \t\t} else {\n * \t\t\treturn 0;\n * \t\t}\n * \t}\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * See `TableHeaderItem` class for more information.\n *\n * ## No data template\n *\n * When table has no data to show, it can show a message you provide it instead.\n *\n * ```html\n * <ibm-table [model]=\"model\">No data.</ibm-table>\n * ```\n *\n * ... will show `No data.` message, but you can get creative and provide any template you want\n * to replace table's default `tbody`.\n *\n * ## Use pagination as table footer\n *\n * ```html\n * <ibm-pagination [model]=\"model\" (selectPage)=\"selectPage($event)\"></ibm-pagination>\n * ```\n *\n * `selectPage()` function should fetch the data from backend, create new `data`, apply it to `model.data`,\n * and update `model.currentPage`.\n *\n * If the data your server returns is a two dimensional array of objects, it would look something like this:\n *\n * ```typescript\n * selectPage(page) {\n * \tthis.getPage(page).then((data: Array<Array<any>>) => {\n * \t\t// set the data and update page\n * \t\tthis.model.data = this.prepareData(data);\n * \t\tthis.model.currentPage = page;\n * \t});\n * }\n *\n * protected prepareData(data: Array<Array<any>>) {\n * \t// create new data from the service data\n * \tlet newData = [];\n * \tdata.forEach(dataRow => {\n * \t\tlet row = [];\n * \t\tdataRow.forEach(dataElement => {\n * \t\t\trow.push(new TableItem({\n * \t\t\t\tdata: dataElement,\n * \t\t\t\ttemplate: typeof dataElement === \"string\" ? undefined : this.paginationTableItemTemplate\n * \t\t\t\t// your template can handle all the data types so you don't have to conditionally set it\n * \t\t\t\t// you can also set different templates for different columns based on index\n * \t\t\t}));\n * \t\t});\n * \t\tnewData.push(row);\n * \t});\n * \treturn newData;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * @export\n * @class Table\n * @implements {AfterContentChecked}\n */\n@Component({\n\tselector: \"ibm-table\",\n\ttemplate: `\n\t<table\n\tclass=\"bx--data-table-v2\"\n\t[ngClass]=\"{\n\t\t'bx--data-table-v2--compact': size === 'sm',\n\t\t'bx--data-table-v2--tall': size === 'lg',\n\t\t'bx--data-table-v2--zebra': striped,\n\t\t'bx--skeleton': skeleton\n\t}\">\n\t\t<thead>\n\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t<th *ngIf=\"model.hasExpandableRows()\"\n\t\t\t\t\t[ibmDataGridFocus]=\"isDataGrid\"\n\t\t\t\t\t[(columnIndex)]=\"columnIndex\"\n\t\t\t\t\t(click)=\"setExpandIndex($event)\">\n\t\t\t\t</th>\n\t\t\t\t<th *ngIf=\"!skeleton && showSelectionColumn\"\n\t\t\t\t\t[ibmDataGridFocus]=\"isDataGrid\"\n\t\t\t\t\t[(columnIndex)]=\"columnIndex\"\n\t\t\t\t\t(click)=\"setCheckboxIndex()\"\n\t\t\t\t\tstyle=\"width: 10px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<ibm-checkbox\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinline=\"true\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[size]=\"size !== ('lg' ?
